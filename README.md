# Flower classification
Using [Iris Species](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris) dataset. It includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower. One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.

The columns in this dataset are:

  * Id
  * SepalLengthCm
  * SepalWidthCm
  * PetalLengthCm
  * PetalWidthCm
  * Species


This neural network implemented in Python using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/?hl=es-419), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and [Keras](https://keras.io/) allows the classification of a flower based on user-provided inputs [SepalLengthCm, SepalWidthCm, PetalLengthCm, PetalWidthCm]. Additionally, it provides supplementary information, such as insights related to the neural network.
